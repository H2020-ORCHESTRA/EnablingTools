It is equal to the absolute difference between the assigned and preferred time-window when the assignment is within the flexibility zone of the truck, or it is equal to $Pn$ otherwise. In practice, $Pn$ should be set to be relatively higher than any ``flexible\" deviation to disincentivize assignment outside the flexibility zone. If $Pn$ is relatively low, the algorithm will prioritize minimization of deviations, even if that may lead to an auction. Conversely, if $Pn$ is relatively high, the avoidance of auctions will be the primary objective."
